                        Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world and the most effective way to break out of the cycle of poverty. Yet, after 70 years of Independence, over two crore children still remain out-of-school in India. These children are not only deprived of their right to receive an education but they lose their childhood to earn bread for a living.
                    </p>    
                    <p class="para1">
                        Forced to stay indoors with schools being shut down, children became one of the worst sufferers of the pandemic. While many children shifted to digital mode of learning, the less privileged children did not have similar access to technology and their education came to a halt.
                        These children have already had difficult journeys, having fought the shackles of poverty, child labour, and much more to finally reach school. But the pandemic has reversed their years of struggle.
